 <h4> ELE Consulting International and Chinese Early Language and Immersion Network (CELIN) at Asia SocietySynopsis:
</h4> 
       <p>To cultivate students who flourish in our MTL Wonderland, we should not approach the transmission of Chinese language and culture as one would a standard school subject. Beyond any course or exam, we are preparing students to embark on a lifelong exploration of the self. Parents and educators need to be familiar with principles at the core of intergenerational linguistic and cultural transmission, relating to how children develop strong social-emotional and cognitive skills, how they develop biliteracy, and how biliteracy interplays with other school subjects. <br/>
Our speaker will be sharing a framework for MTL development in an educational ecosystem, drawing upon studies in early childhood development, heritage language education, bilingual and biliteracy development, and language immersion education. She offers practical strategies, applicable in daily life and learning, to guide students towards a healthy self-identity, high proficiency and literacy in MTL and English, and global competency for intergenerational connection and intercultural engagement.
